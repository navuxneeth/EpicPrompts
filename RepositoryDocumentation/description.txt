This collection of prompts automates the generation and maintenance of comprehensive documentation for code repositories by analyzing the entire codebase and extracting relevant information. The prompts can generate README.md files with structured sections including project descriptions, functionality explanations, setup and installation instructions, file structure visualizations, usage examples, API documentation, configuration options, credits for dependencies, and owner details. Additionally, they can suggest and generate appropriate LICENSE files based on the desired level of openness and commercial use. The collection includes multiple versions: makeReadme for creating documentation from scratch, optimizedTopics for generating specific documentation topics, and various syncReadme versions (V1-V4) offering different levels of update depth from basic file structure synchronization to comprehensive deep analysis of code logic, dependencies, build scripts, and configuration changes, ensuring documentation stays perfectly aligned with the current state of the repository throughout its lifecycle.
