This prompt enables the design of complete terminal-style user interfaces with authentic vintage computing aesthetics, emulating classic command-line interfaces, BBS systems, and early Unix/DOS terminals from the 1970s-1990s. It provides comprehensive specifications for creating terminal UIs with multiple components including command prompts with blinking cursors, menu systems with keyboard shortcuts, status bars and info panels, ASCII art headers and dividers, scrollable content areas with terminal-style pagination, and interactive form elements rendered in text mode. The prompt defines detailed visual guidelines for terminal styles (Unix green-on-black, DOS blue, BBS colored ANSI art, cyberpunk neon), color schemes with authentic terminal palettes, typography using monospaced fonts like Courier or modern alternatives like Fira Code, CRT screen effects (scanlines, glow, phosphor persistence, slight curve), text animation patterns (character-by-character typing, matrix-style cascading text, blinking elements), keyboard interaction handling, and responsive behavior adapted to terminal constraints, making it perfect for developer tools, command-line style web applications, retro gaming interfaces, cyberpunk-themed experiences, and nostalgic computing experiences that celebrate the aesthetic and interaction patterns of classic terminals.
