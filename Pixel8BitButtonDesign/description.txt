This prompt generates UI button components in authentic 8-bit pixel art style, perfectly replicating the visual aesthetic of classic retro computing and gaming interfaces from the 1980s and early 1990s. It provides comprehensive specifications for creating buttons with pixelated typography using monospaced bitmap-style fonts (like VT323), thick pixel borders with sharp corners, flat color fills without gradients, and optional dithering patterns for texture. The prompt defines multiple button states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading) with instant or stepped animations that avoid smooth transitions, maintaining the authentic low-resolution charm of vintage systems. It includes detailed color schemes with specific hex values for primary, secondary, danger, success, and warning variants, along with guidelines for sizing, iconography integration, accessibility considerations, and implementation approaches for both CSS-based and SVG/Canvas rendering methods, making it ideal for nostalgic web applications, retro-themed games, and vintage terminal-inspired interfaces.
