## About The Project

This repository is a work-in-progress, containing a collection of meticulously crafted prompts that have been tested and found to work beautifully. The goal is to provide a resource for anyone looking to leverage the full potential of advanced Generative AI models for creative and technical tasks.

The prompts are structured in JSON format for clarity and ease of use. They are designed to be detailed and comprehensive, ensuring high-quality and specific outputs from the AI.

We welcome collaboration and contributions! If you have a powerful prompt you'd like to share, feel free to open a pull request.

### Compatibility

These prompts are designed for high-token count, multimodal models (default Temperature etc. settings) released after **June 2025**, such as:
* Google DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 Pro (and subsequent versions)
* OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-5 and subsequent high-token models)
* Other similar advanced consumer-scale multimodal Generative AI tools
