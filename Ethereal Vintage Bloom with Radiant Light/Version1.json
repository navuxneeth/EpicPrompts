      "summary": "A soft-focus, ethereal portrait of a woman sitting on the railing of an ornate, green gazebo or pagoda. The scene is heavily backlit by a bright, diffused light source, likely the sun, creating a dreamy and hazy atmosphere with significant lens flare and bloom effects. The overall color palette is dominated by muted greens and warm, glowing highlights.",
