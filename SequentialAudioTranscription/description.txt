This prompt facilitates the sequential transcription of multiple audio files with comprehensive metadata extraction, designed specifically for academic research and professional documentation needs. It processes audio files one by one in order, generating verbatim-plus transcriptions that include disfluencies, pauses, and natural speech patterns for maximum fidelity. Beyond simple transcription, it extracts valuable metadata from the audio content itself, including speaker information such as gender, estimated age, and names when mentioned, handling multilingual content by transcribing in the original language and providing inline English translations in parentheses. The output is formatted with uniform, descriptive titles following a template that combines the person's name, original filename, gender, and age, making it easy to organize and reference multiple transcripts. The prompt enforces research-grade accuracy standards with strict prohibition against hallucination, maintains context persistence throughout the entire processing session, and includes resource management to handle token limits gracefully, making it ideal for interview processing, meeting documentation, podcast content extraction, academic research, and accessibility compliance requirements.
