This prompt defines a comprehensive photographic style for generating images with an ethereal, dreamlike, and cinematic aesthetic that evokes fleeting cherished memories wrapped in a luminous, nostalgic haze. It meticulously specifies every aspect of the visual language including lighting (soft, glowing golden hour with blown-out highlights and pronounced bloom), color grading (warm golden highlights contrasted with cool cyan/teal shadows), lens effects (shallow depth of field, soft focus, vintage lens flares, heavy vignetting), composition techniques (rule of thirds, negative space, leading lines, natural framing), and motion dynamics (environmental and subject motion blur, panning effects). The style draws inspiration from arthouse cinema, Pictorialist photography, and the characteristic imperfections of aged 35mm film stock, creating images that feel like beautiful half-forgotten dreams with a painterly, organic quality enhanced by fine film grain and reduced digital sharpness.
