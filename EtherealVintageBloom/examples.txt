Example 1: A young woman in a flowing white dress standing in a golden wheat field at sunset, with rays of light streaming through atmospheric dust, her hair gently blown by the wind, gazing pensively into the distance.

Example 2: A solitary figure walking down a rain-soaked city street at dusk, with motion-blurred neon lights reflecting on wet pavement, car headlights creating lens flares, and a soft glow surrounding the subject.

Example 3: A child running through a sun-dappled forest clearing, with motion blur on the surrounding foliage, god rays piercing through the tree canopy, and shallow depth of field keeping the subject in soft focus while the background melts into dreamy bokeh.

Example 4: A vintage car parked on a coastal cliff at golden hour, with the sun creating intense bloom and halation effects, the ocean in soft focus in the background, and lens flares adding a nostalgic quality.

Example 5: A couple embracing on a train platform with panning motion blur showing passing trains, warm light from overhead lamps creating a glowing halo effect, and cool-toned shadows filling the darker areas of the scene.
