This meta-instruction prompt establishes execution parameters and quality standards for complex, large-scale AI tasks that require sustained attention and high accuracy. It serves as a preliminary instruction that sets the context and expectations before defining the actual task, explicitly prioritizing quality over speed with an emphasis on taking sufficient time for thorough processing. The prompt establishes cognitive requirements for exhaustive comprehension depth, ensuring the AI fully understands all provided information and maintains persistent awareness of the entire task context throughout the process. It enforces research-grade accuracy standards with strict prohibition against hallucination or fabricated information, making it particularly suitable for academic research purposes. By setting these execution policies upfront, it helps manage user expectations for resource-intensive single-prompt workflows while ensuring the AI dedicates appropriate computational resources and maintains unwavering focus on accuracy, thoroughness, and context retention, ultimately leading to more reliable and comprehensive outputs for demanding tasks such as complex analysis, detailed documentation, or multi-step problem-solving.
